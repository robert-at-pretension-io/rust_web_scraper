We couldn’t have achieved the product experience delivered to our customers without LangChain, and we couldn’t have done it at the same pace without LangSmith.”  
> — James Spiteri, Director of Security Products

> “As soon as we heard about LangSmith, we moved our entire development stack onto it. We could have built evaluation, testing, and monitoring tools in house, but with LangSmith it took us 10x less time to get a 1000x better tool.”
