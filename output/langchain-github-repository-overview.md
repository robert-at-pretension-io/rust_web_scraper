### Quick Install
With pip:
```
pip install langchain
```
With conda:
```
conda install langchain -c conda-forge
```

## ü§î What is LangChain?
**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

### Open-source Libraries
- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.

### Productionization
- [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com): A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework.

### Deployment
- [LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/): Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants.

## üß± What can you build with LangChain?
- **Question answering with RAG**: 
  - [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/)
  - End-to-end example: [Chat LangChain](https://chat.langchain.com)

- **Extracting structured output**:
  - [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/extraction/)

- **Chatbots**:
  - [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/chatbot/)
  
## üöÄ How does LangChain help?
1. **Components**: Composable building blocks, tools, and integrations for working with language models.
2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: Built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks.

### Documentation
Refer to [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com) for more.

## üåê Ecosystem
- [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com): Trace and evaluate your language model applications.
- [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/): Create stateful, multi-actor applications.
- [LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve): Deploy LangChain runnables and chains as REST APIs.
